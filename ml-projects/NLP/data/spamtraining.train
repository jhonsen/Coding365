" ( john , characteristic wry humor , asked wanted anything back . ) harris bemusedly questioned whether anyone interested was doing . nonetheless , gave public lecture " two structures language : report paraphrase " 1969 1970 , large auditorium ( was furness building ) was filled capacity , critique john corcoran , published later volume _ transformationelle analyse _ edited senta ploetz , was attended . broad attendance acclaim work easily been , had chosen . is simply where ambitions lay . clue basis choice against fame influence perhaps found advice student starting first teaching position , many years ago . n't invite anybody over dinner , said , n't accept invitations . involved social life academic , won't able work done . work came first . harris was always intensely loyal man friends family . consequences , combined laissez-faire anarchism , were always happy . friend close colleague many years , henry hiz , was much concerned building formal linguistics program institution . disparity character devastating students . studied harris 1966 through 1970 . was undergraduate much , did matter . had sink-or - swim approach attributed sapir ( darnell 1990 ) , except seminars were course focussed theory rather data , , athabaskan . seminar start talking was working . started , was work resulted 1968 book , _ mathematical structures language _ ( wiley ) . process was lecture monologue , continuing conversation students , trying alternatives , posing working problems mathematical characterization language . after while , intensive reading outside , one began catch participate . recall telling end one seminar meeting first try disprove theory . troubled bit . worked problem modern greek thought might troublesome approach . ( had lived greece couple years , spoke language , worked informant project . ) results turned actually corroborate point had intended challenge , merely thanked data greek . two later , had proposal analyze definitions dictionary extract semantic primitives form componential analysis , much martha evens others done . although notion semantic features seems inimical concept method work , said ( is exact quote ) " others tried failed , are welcome try . " offer refutation sometimes heard view harris was dictatorial . ran conflicts matters hiz , never harris . heard asked why never retorted attacks work . did matter . did expect methods results understood taken everyone field linguistics . maybe attitude differed 1940s , wrote structural restatements manuscript eventually published _ methods structural linguistics _ . ( btw , title was said " descriptive " publisher substituted buzzword " structural . " recall saying , amusedly , " n't remember whether asked . " ) maybe expectations field changed after chomsky 's followers began making bad guy . n't , based writings testimony were students . never heard comment commonplace attribution chomsky discovery transformational grammar " transformational revolution . " is passage _ state art _ ( 1968 ) hockett attributes harris " nothing , long silence , after 1957 , " showing ignorance things string analysis , might excused , even ignoring 1965 paper transformational theory prominently published _ language _ . showed passage harris , shrugged . did matter . particular , never saw evidence harris opposed blocked chomsky 's ambitions . experience been entirely character . example , was harris proposed chomsky speak stead 1962 international congress . similar canard regarding bernard bloch has recently been laid rest editorial language . one must alert social psychology leads rewrite history avatar is depicted embattled hero . , old indian friend once told one cannot point finger without having three fingers same hand pointing back , hasten add is picture intend paint here harris . accomplished intended quite , thank much , seems been quite happy process . point is precisely seemed embattled attacks uncomprehending misconstruals work . uncomprehending misconstruals abound . frawley 's review _ grammar english mathematical principles _ ( gemp ) is example . identifies harris 's operator grammar predicate calculus , though harris is pains delineate critical differences between language ( fortiori operator grammar ) language-like mathematical systems , including predicate calculus . frawley comprehensive grammar attempt 1960s generative grammar 1980 , is unable step generativist paradigm understand harris 's work own terms . another review ( eric wheeler , 1984 _ computers humanities _ ) asserted harris 's grammar was unable account certain familiar semantic problems - - middle voice , semantics vs . seek , quantifier scope examples " someone was opposed everyone . " review ( _ computational linguistics _ 1984 ) showed harris did fact account each problems book . michael kac , review harris 's selected writings , asked " why bother ? " indeed , within generativist paradigm must plausible question . is setting aside paradigmatic blinkers one , having writings one place , consistent self coherent harris 's program has been over years . transformational grammar was revolutionary break part continuous evolution . mention one misconception harris 's work , is fundamental is commonplace . probably greeted disbelief discovery procedures were aim .

" nothing else , harris was always careful exactly meant . concern verification arises deeper concern becomes explicit harris 's later work . is critical point linguistics . science , is standpoint external science domain metascience . particular , practitioners physics , chemistry , even mathematics , rely " background vernacular " language ensure communication shared meanings ultimately validate relation conclusions , however reached , observations are based . science language . harris recognized accepted is vantage point outside language describe language . , observably , each language contains own metalanguage .

ham	Subject: re : 5 . 1237 sum : basic word order ( remarks typology )fritz newmeyer raises important issues typological research instantiated nichols ' work elsewhere , call comments . first , notion language type is idealization : is often made clear typology courses , where non-existent artificial languages are considered logically possible impossible language types , always published literature ( though point is clearly made comrie 's textbook , example , discussion morphological typology ) . similarly , fritz is quite right point assumption areal genetic bias , extent is made , is counterfactual one . ask is whether idealizations differ kind those , many counterfactual , underlie generative grammar . justification is similar both cases : methodologically , one cannot deal relevant variables , concepts used are logically independent extrinsic variables , e . g . one investigate consistency proposed implicational universals regardless statistical bias one 's sample . term ` shaky typological pigeon-holing ' is particularly inapt applied nichols ' distinction between head-marking dependent - marking languages , is quite explicitly matter degree ( 1986 paper where degree hm vs . dm is quantifified terms number patterns instantiating each type ) . nichols refers ` head-marking language ' is shorthand quantifiable tendency , might describe italian ` pro-drop language ' without implying is binary distinction here ( fact are degrees pro-drop , e . g . languages allow null expletives null referential subjects , etc ) . another point typologists accept is languages n't appear match established type are typological data - example , colloquial french discussed recently linguist is language might reasonably described having basic word order ( believe nichols classified vso one tables , is again shorthand complex situation ) . is explanandum nichols ' 1986 paper offers explanation : head-marking facilitates word order freedom , colloquial french instantiates clausal head-marking nichols ' sense . sum : pace widespread opinion , typologists ' goal is pigeon-holing ( " taxonomy " is widely used context ! ) investigation explanation patterns variation . steve matthews

's bit complicated syntax - - syntax is complicated overall phonology . basically , analog phonemes words are words sentences . true , difference between words sentences is general sentences are stored lexicon . neither are many complex words ( rendering morphological reconstruction similarly difficult , nobody seems ever objected morphological reconstruction ) , sentences are actually stored , e . g . proverbs idioms , often show syntactic archaisms . since earlier syntax often survives " fossilized " form later morphology , another rich source data diachronic syntax . addition regularity change , need general principles change plausible reconstruction , e . g . phonological principles predict likely changes assimilation , lenition , segment loss , etc . syntax , similar principles change exist : spatial nouns become spatial adpositions , certain general verbs become tense aspect markers , allative case markers become dative case markers , purposive verb forms become infinitives , etc . processes ( instances grammaticalization ) are irreversible changes provide safe guides linguists seeking sense daughter language diversity reconstructing proto-syntax . massive regularities grammaticalization are generally ignored generative studies syntactic change ( indeed , lightfoot argues are genuine principles diachronic syntax ) , one takes account , help difficult task reconstruction . martin haspelmath ( free university berlin )

ham	Subject: genetic classificationwish comments issue recent discussion nostratic problem " demonstrating " distant genetic relationships has skirted around believe underlies issues various been directly addressing . assumption seems underly much discussion is hypotheses regarding genetic relationships are interesting unless proven true . rather odd assumption , one does seem made kinds hypotheses linguistics ( anywhere else science far ) . let us set aside sake argument oft-noted point notion proof is really applicable empirical hypotheses , assume term is used loosely arbitrary high level certainty . seems fair is fairly widespread disinterest hypotheses nostratic hypothesis is widely believed ( assume is true here sake argument ) available evidence nostratic falls short imaginary level certainty deserves label " proven " . common type reaction unproven hypotheses is has been demonstrated observed similarities might due chance / borrowing . suppose someone were same attitude towards comparative reconstruction protolanguages . suppose someone were object comparative reconstruction anything shallow groups grounds one never prove reconstructions are correct . one object certain claims genetic relationships grounds one cannot conclusively eliminate possibility observed similarities might due accident / borrowing , one equally object virtually hypotheses surrounding comparative reconstruction grounds one cannot conclusively eliminate alternative possibilities . comparative method is best guess one protolanguage ; never provides proof reconstruction is fact correct . why bother doing ? answer obvious : hypotheses represent our best guesses point are much science is . why many linguists seem object applying same thinking hypotheses genetic relationships ? why is many historical linguists hypotheses nostratic hypothesis either laughable upsetting ? why n't react same comparative reconstructions , since are " unproven " ? why n't rush read everything nostratic conclude " evidence is tantalizing conclusive ; 's really exciting hypothesis " ? why is double standard ? want suggest answer question , answer , right , provides insight nature many debates surrounding controversial hypotheses genetic relationship . namely , questions genetic classification intrinsically interesting , quite apart detailed historical work plays role supporting hypotheses . , however , are primarily interested detailed historical work itself , questions genetic classification intrinsically interesting , interesting far are inevitable consequence historical work . first sort are likely recent work reclassifying penutian languages exciting , while latter sort are unlikely react , unless are penutian specialists . one moves back , ability apply comparative method becomes increasingly difficult , detailed historical work becomes increasingly speculative ( many historical linguists , dissatisfying ) . depth , always much confident genetic classification comparative reconstructions . our confidence indo - european language family is surely greater our confidence specific claims proto - indo - european . move further back , expect hypotheses cannot entirely confident , is least promising evidence , where comparative reconstruction is going sufficiently speculative satisfying linguists interested traditional comparative work . since linguists are interested genetic classification except biproduct detailed historical work , linguists are likely hypotheses uninteresting . hand , linguists questions genetic classification inherently interesting , fact detailed historical work possible is irrelevant , fact hypothesis is unproven unprovable source concern fact comparative reconstructions are always unproven unprovable . view is correct , much debate surrounding controversial hypotheses genetic classification is based , substantive questions , simply sorts questions different interesting . matthew dryer

" language small corpus has + 5 - 5 diurnal units system is erromangan ( vanuatu ) . ask source erromangan answer question . is inherent problem determining number expressions diurnal units . is determining whether expressions are lexemes phrases . many languages seem " lexicalised " ( want better term ) prepositional / nominal phrases . languages , example english expression ` day before yesterday ' , retained phrase structure . one respondent supplied lengthy discussion lexeme / phrase issue . cites case bulgarian ( hope won't mind including discussion here ) : [ begin quote ] bulgarian presents [ interesting ] situation regard phrase / lexeme issue does n't real nominal case paradigm : onzi den - 2 ( lit .

" day " ) same form ' pozavchera ' bulgarian ( stress penultimate syllable ; russian ' pozavchera ' has stress final syllable ) perhaps does n't strange one n't expect ' po ' require particular case ending . however , again looks preposition adverb , exist phrase . bulgarian " tomorrow " is ' utre ' . " day after tomorrow " is ' vdrugiden ' - - . e . , phrase ' v drugi den ' ( lit . " ( ) day " , written without spaces between individual words . considered word simply orthographic grounds , though ? is prepositional phrase adverb ? course boundary between prepositional phrases adverbs is fuzzy begin . bulgarian " day before yesterday " , contrast , is looks noun phrase : ' onja den ' - - " day " . preposition ' v ' ( " " ) here . considered np prepositional phrase ? ' onja den ' is used same ' vdrugiden ' - - ' vidjax onja den ' - - " saw [ ] day before yesterday " . seems 's written noun phrase here is really adverb , ' vdrugiden ' russian ' pozavchera ' ' poslezavtra ' , difference being three adverbs are formed prepositional phrases while ' onja den ' has preposition . sound strange call prepositional phrase , , unlike ' vdrugiden ' , contains preposition . call adverbial phrase . ( expressions slavic languages are commonly accusative , origin ' onja den ' , since modern bulgarian has lost nominal case paradigm most part makes harder determine status phrases one . ( cf . russian ' kazhduju nedelju ' ( " each - acc week - acc " ) , means " every week " adverbial sense . ) bulgarian does n't specific words " day before day before yesterday " - - , , ' v denja predi onja den ' ( " day before day before yesterday " ) , course speakers avoid ' predi dva dena ' ( " two days ago " , lit . " before two days " ) . same true ' vdrugiden ' - - ' v denja sled vdrugiden ' is conceivably possible ( " day after the-day - after-tomorrow " ) , speakers 's led dva dena ' ( " / after two days " ) . difficult here draw demarcation line here between grammatical categories words vs . phrases .

( both words are accented syllable russian . ) term evidently entered russian turkic language , probably kumyk ( spoken northern eastern caucasian plain ) . chechens call themselves nokhchi ( singular nokhchuo ) . similarly , " ingush " is self-designation russian ethnonym based village name ; ingush call themselves ghalghay . demography . 1989 census figures : 956 , 879 chechen ; 237 , 438 ingush . chechens are largest north caucasian group second largest caucasian group ( after georgians ) . location , settlement . chechen ingush lands lie east principal road crossing central caucasus ( via darial pass ) , extending foothills plains alpine highlands . lowlands enjoy fertile soil , ample rainfall , long growing season , small oilfield . neighbors east are various peoples daghestan ( many speaking languages related chechen ) ; plains north , turkic - speaking kumyk ( three centuries ) russians ; west ingush west ossetians , speak language iranian branch indo - european ; south ( across central caucasus range ) southern ossetians georgians . are two true cities chechen ingush territory : grozny ( pop . 400 , 000 until 1995 ) , modern chechen capital founded russian fort during russian conquest caucasus ; vladikavkaz ( pop . 300 , 000 ; known ordzhonikidze soviet times ) ingush highlands ingush - ossetic territorial boundary , originally russian military fort founded control darial pass . nazran ingush lowlands was traditionally is large important market town . cities had substantial russian non - chechen - ingush population ; vladikavkaz was mixed ingush ossetic significant numbers russians georgians . ( groznyj has been destroyed mostly depopulated russian bombing . vladikavkaz adjacent ingush lands were ethnically cleansed ingush late 1992 . ) russian governments - - czars , soviets , post - soviet russia - - used various means remove chechen ingush population economically important areas encourage settlement russians russian cossacks ; hence mixed population cities lowlands . language . caucasus has been famed since antiquity sheer number diversity languages exotic grammatical structures language families indigenous . diversity testifies millennia generally peaceable relations among autonomous ethnic groups . chechen ingush , together batsbi tsova - tush ( moribund minority language georgia ) nakh branch nakh - daghestanian , northeast caucasian , language family . are over 30 languages northeast caucasian family , most spoken daghestan east chechnya . split nakh branch rest family took place 5000-6000 years ago ( thus nakh - daghestanian family is comparable age indo - european , language family ancestral english , french , russian , greek , hindi , etc . ) , though split chechen ingush probably dates back middle ages . entire family is indigenous caucasus mountains has demonstrable relations language group either caucasus . most indigenous caucasian languages chechen has wealth consonants , including uvular pharyngeal sounds those arabic glottalized ejective consonants those many native american languages ; large vowel system somewhat resembling swedish german . sister languages chechen has extensive inflectional morphology including dozen nominal cases several gender classes , forms long complex sentences chaining participial clauses together . case system is ergative , . e . subject transitive verb appears oblique case direct object is nominative , is subject intransitive verb ( basque ) ; verbs person agreement , agree gender direct object intransitive subject . 97 % chechens claim chechen first language , though most speak russian , generally quite fluently . chechen ingush are close each practice speaker one has fair comprehension , where two languages are contact are used together : chechen addresses ingush chechen , ingush replies ingush , communication proceeds less smoothly . chechen was traditionally written language . orthography using russian alphabet was created 1930 's is used various kinds publication , although most chechens chief vehicle literacy is russian . traditionally , most north caucasian societies , many individuals were bilingual multilingual , using important lowlands language ( e . g . kumyk , spoken market towns prestigious speakers were early converts islam ) inter-ethnic communication ; literacy was arabic . russian has displaced both kumyk arabic functions . particularly chechen ingush economies continue destroyed unemployment mass homelessness continue undermine social structure , is danger chechen ingush functionally reduced household languages yield completely russian , concomitant loss much cultural heritage . history . chechens evidently been near present territory 6000 years perhaps much longer ; is fairly seamless archeological continuity 8000 years central daghestan , suggesting nakh - daghestanian language family is long indigenous . caucasian highlands were apparently relatively populous prosperous ancient times . late middle ages until 19th century , worldwide cooling phase known little ice age caused glacial advances shortened growing seasons alpine highlands , weakening highland economies triggering migrations lowlands abandonment alpine villages . period economic hardship coincided russian conquest caucasus lasted late 1500 's mid - 1800 's . recorded history inferable prehistory chechens ( matter ingush ) never undertaken battle except defense . russian conquest caucasus was difficult bloody , chechens ingush extensive lowlands territory access central pass were prime targets were among most tenacious defenders . russia destroyed lowlands villages deported , exiled , slaughtered civilian population , forcing capitulation highlands . numerous refugees migrated were deported various muslim countries middle east , day are chechen populations jordan turkey . since been various chechen rebellions against russian soviet power , resistance collectivization , anti-religious campaigns , russification . 1944 chechens ingush , together karachay - balkar , crimean tatars , nationalities were deported en masse kazakhstan siberia , losing least one-quarter perhaps half population transit . though " rehabilitated " 1956 allowed return 1957 , lost land , economic resources , civil rights ; since , under both soviet post - soviet governments , been objects ( official unofficial ) discrimination discriminatory public discourse . recent years , russian media depicted chechen nation / nationality thugs bandits responsible organized crime street violence russia . late 1992 russian tanks troops , sent north caucasus ostensibly peacekeepers ethnic dispute between ingush ossetians over traditional ingush lands politically incorporated north ossetia after 1944 deportation , forcibly removed ingush population north ossetia destroyed ingush villages ;

" _ risk _ positive np complement - - _ risked fortune _ is perfectly ok - - clausal one , . e . expanded _ risked losing fortune _ , ? ? _ risked winning fortune _ is impossible . " eric pederson claudia brugman informed chuck fillmore has written paper " risk " . claudia writes : " [ ] sue atkins charles fillmore n't whether ' ve published ( indeed finished ) yet , talk two meanings word terms selection complements different aspects conceptual / semantic frame : one is where desired outcome is selected , is where " collateral " is selected . " n't seen paper yet , was comforting extent seems cognizance impression . however , suspect " collateral " means simple np expressing desirable object , scott allows , clausal complement . thus replies suggested " risked life " expanded " risked * losing * life " . admit sounds better " risked * keeping * ( ? ) life " . nevertheless , theory is rush learn english made following logical leap . " risk life " is risk something , risk " winning t game " , " losing game " . risking fines , death , imprisonment cancer were later experiences .
