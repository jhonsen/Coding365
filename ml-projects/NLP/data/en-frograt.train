frog Imagine traveling back through time millions of years to the age of the dinosaurs. Pterodactyls glide above a soggy marsh. Nearby, a colossal 80-ton Brachiosaurus munches on a tree. On the ground at its feet, something strangely familiar hops by: a frog.
frog Surprised? Few people realize just how ancient frogs are. For 190 million years, the ancestors of modern frogs have roamed (if not ruled) the earth, looking much the same as they do today. The secret to their success is their amazing adaptability.
frog As amphibians, frogs have one webbed foot in each of two worlds. The advantages of this double life are clear to see: Are land predators giving you trouble? Dive into the water. Not enough to eat in the pond? Hop out and see what they're serving on shore.
frog Frogs have evolved to live in an astounding variety of climates. They can be found just about anywhere there's fresh water, from the desert to the Arctic, on all continents except Antarctica. Though they thrive in warm, moist tropical climates, frogs also live in deserts and high on 15,000 foot mountain slopes. The Australian water-holding frog is a desert dweller that can wait up to seven years for rain. It burrows underground and surrounds itself in a transparent cocoon made of its own shed skin.
frog Like all amphibians, frogs are cold-blooded, meaning that their body temperatures change with the temperature of their surroundings. When temperatures drop, some frogs dig burrows underground or in the mud at the bottom of ponds. They hibernate in these burrows until spring, perfectly still and scarcely breathing. Wood frogs can live north of the Arctic Circle, surviving for weeks in a frozen limbo state. This frog uses glucose in its blood as a kind of antifreeze that concentrates in its vital organs, protecting them from damage while the rest of the body freezes solid.
rat The laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, belongs to the order Rodentia and family Muridae. Rats were first used for experimental purposes in the mid 1800s. Strains were developed to study neuroanatomy, nutrition, endocrinology, genetics and behavior.
rat The rat has short hair, a long naked tail, rounded erect ears, protruding eyes, a pointed snout with long whisker (vibrissae) and five toes on each foot. Albino rats have poor eyesight and depend on facial vibrissae and olfaction for sensory input. Rats have no gall bladder. Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) has a short tail compared to Rattus rattus (black rat), which has a much longer tail.
rat Rats have a pair of incisors and three pairs upper and lower of molars. Molars are permanently rooted while the incisors have an open root and grow continuously. Due to this continuous growth of the incisors rats can have problems with incisor overgrowth when the upper and lower incisors do not meet properly (malocclusion). Malocclusion can be hereditary or follow trauma, disease or inappropriate diet and/or soft food. There is no permanent cure for overgrown teeth. The only treatment is to trim the teeth every 2-3 weeks, if malocclusion persists.
rat Rats have a large horseshoe-shaped Harderian gland deep within the orbit. Secretions from the gland contain varying amount a reddish-brown porphyrin pigment depending on the physiologic state, age, strain and sex of the rat. The amount of secretions increases during stress and appears as 'red crusts' around the eyes and nostrils.
rat Rats are communal animals. Young are raised communally with shared nursing responsibilities. Males can be co housed as fighting rarely occurs among adults. Rats are burrowers and take advantage of that whenever the opportunity presented. They are nocturnal animals but adapt to their environments. Rats can inflict severe bite wounds and must be handled gently and with care to avoid biting.
