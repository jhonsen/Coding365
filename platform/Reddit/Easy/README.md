- iPython kernel comes built-in with Jupyter distribution
- To install a Java kernel, e.g., via `iJava` via [see here](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava)
- To install a Scala kernel, e.g., via `almond` via [see here](https://github.com/almond-sh/almond)

#### Overview of Directory 
1. Read explanations in notebooks, e.g.,  
    - ./Necklace/[Necklace.ipynb](./Necklace/Necklace.ipynb)  
2. Run programs on terminal, e.g.,  
    - Using **Python**
      - `$> python ./Necklace/src/Necklace.py`
    - Using **Java**
      - `$> javac ./Necklace/Necklace.java`
      - `$> java ./Necklace/Necklace`
